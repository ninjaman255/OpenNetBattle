# ‚ùì ABOUT
Follow this project on :bird: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenNetBattle)!

This project aims to be an accurate mmbn6 battle engine that can be used to program custom enemies, chips, navis, or used to make your own mmbn story.
This was originally started to kill some time one summer and I got a little carried away. It's been fun and I hope you have fun with it as I have had making it.

# üïπÔ∏è GET STARTED PLAYING THE GAME

To begin, follow the [Playing Guide](https://github.com/TheMaverickProgrammer/OpenNetBattle/wiki/Playing-Guide).

Below are the default bindings. The engine supports 1 joystick. You can change these bindings from within the game's `Config` screen.

```
ARROWS -> Move / UI options
Z      -> Shoot (hold to charge) / UI Confirm / Interact
X      -> Use chip / UI Cancel / Run
C      -> Special ability / Misc. Action
A      -> Scan Left / Misc. Action
S      -> Scan Right / Bring up chip select GUI / Talk to navi
M      -> Display map
RETURN -> Pause
```
